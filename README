- Download and install the latest version of Pycharm : https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ and follow the installation steps.

- Once you succesfully installed Pycharm, go to this link and copy the code: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redouanelh/Oefening/master/Miniproject%20Complete.py
  Inside Pycharm, make a new Python file and paste this code inside.

- Inside the code, press CTRL+F and search for gif1, in this line you should see file='ns20.png'.
  Delete 'ns20.png' and place the directory of where you saved the 'NS PNG' we provided in this zip file.

- Look at the top left and press 'File', then open 'settings'. Search for the Project you saved the code into, then click on 'Project Intepreter'.
  Then at the right side, you should see a little '+' icon, press that. Now search for 'xmltodict' and install the package.
  Do the same for the package 'requests'.

- Now you should be able to run the code by pressing the top right green 'play' button, or just simply by pressing SHIFT+F10.

- NOTE: If you press CTRL+F and search for 'inputdatabase.csv', you don't need to worry about creating this file.
        Pycharm will automatically create a new .csv file called 'inputdatabase.csv' which will save all the inputs given by the user.

- NOTE: This 'README.txt' file can also be found on Github: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Redouanelh/Oefening/master/README
